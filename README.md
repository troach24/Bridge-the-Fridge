# ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ½ Bridge The Fridge ðŸ¥¦ðŸ¥•

Have you ever opened your fridge and spent too much time wondering what the heck you are going to make for dinner? Often times we let ingredients go bad because we either buy too much at one time, or don't make the best use of what we have to create a dish.

Here is your solution! This application is designed to bridge what you have in your fridge into your stomach, instead of the trash. This is a fun and easy way to get cooking quickly, and may also inspire some new ideas along the way - giving you some insight on what you will want to pick up from the store on your next visit.
